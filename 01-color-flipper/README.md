# Color Flipper

## Introduction

**Color Flipper** is a personal project that creates an interactive web page to add random colors to the body of the webpage with a click of a button. This project consists of two webpages, each offering a unique way to apply colors:

1. **Simple Page**: This webpage allows you to apply colors to the webpage's body using color names such as "aqua," "red", "maroon" and more.

2. **Hex Page**: On this webpage, hexadecimal color codes are generated randomly and applied to the webpage's body by clicking the button. This provides a wider range of colors to play with and creates unique colors for the webpage.

## Technologies Used

I developed the Color Flipper project using the following technologies:

- HTML: For structuring the webpages.
- CSS: For styling the webpages.
- JavaScript: For generating random colors and applying them to the body of the webpage.
